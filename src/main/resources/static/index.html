<p>
I want my project to be a database that stores facts about space. I'll categorize them (ex: by all categories, planet, constellation, moon, and galaxy facts). <br>
I'll have a page that lists all of the categories, and then the user will be able to click on a category and get all of the facts for that particular category. <br>
I also want the ability to add facts to the database. <br>
Stretch Goals: <br>
Ability to search by keyword (I'll have to assign keywords to each fact) <br>
Ability to delete facts
